# FaceRecognition
Smart Attendance System using Facial Recognition uses Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces and records the attendance in excel sheet
# HaarCascade Classifier
A Haar cascade classifier is an object detection algorithm used to identify objects in images or video streams. It is particularly effective for detecting objects with distinct features, such as faces. The algorithm is based on the Haar wavelet technique, which analyzes the intensity differences in different regions of an image. A Haar cascade classifier uses a set of trained features called Haar-like features, which are simple rectangular filters that calculate the difference between the sum of pixel intensities in adjacent rectangular regions.
